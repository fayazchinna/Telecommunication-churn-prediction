# Telecommunication-churn-prediction
Developed a machine learning model to predict customer churn using Python and scikit-learn. Achieved an accuracy of 90% by optimizing feature selection and hyperparameters

This project analyzes customer churn to help businesses understand why customers leave and identify patterns that contribute to churn. By implementing data preprocessing, visualization, machine learning models, and business analysis, this project aims to predict churn and derive actionable insights to improve customer retention strategies.

✨ Project Overview
Customer churn analysis is crucial for businesses aiming to retain their customer base. This project identifies key patterns that lead to churn and builds predictive models that help in forecasting customer behavior.

📊 Key Features
Data Preprocessing

Cleaned and transformed raw data, handling missing values and outliers.
Encoded categorical variables and normalized numerical features.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Data Visualization

Explored key patterns with visualizations like histograms, bar charts, and heatmaps.
Identified significant features impacting churn, such as customer demographics and behavior metrics.
Machine Learning Models

Built and evaluated multiple machine learning models:
Logistic Regression
Decision Trees
Random Forest
Gradient Boosting
Tuned hyperparameters for optimal performance.
Evaluated models based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Business Analysis

Analyzed churn insights to provide actionable business recommendations.
Identified high-risk customer segments.
Suggested strategies to improve customer retention based on analysis results.
🛠️ Installation
